# spmenu-themes

Repository of user themes for spmenu

# Usage (Legacy)

**NOTE: These are only functional on spmenu 1.0 and before. spmenu 1.1+ users
should use the newer themes with the .conf extension.**

Copy the themes to ~/.config/spmenu/profiles/ and run the profile menu
(by default Ctrl+Alt+p). Then simply select the theme you want to use.

# Usage

**NOTE: These are only functional on spmenu 1.1 and newer. People using older
versions should use the legacy themes instead.**

Copy the theme you want to use to ~/.config/spmenu/theme.conf and restart spmenu.

# Contributions

Want to contribute a sweet new theme you've made? Sweet. Note that both legacy
and normal themes are accepted, but legacy themes are **only** accepted if
a regular theme is included as well.

Also note that your configuration files need to be licensed under the MIT license
to be available in this repository.

# Theme managers

**NOTE: Only applies to users of spmenu 1.1 and newer.**

spmenu does not include a theme manager by default, but you can install one
if you want. An official theme manager is still in the works. See
[this repo](https://git.speedie.site/spmenuify) for more information.
